Creating a Tetris Game web application using HTML involves developing a digital version of the classic puzzle game that users can play directly in a web browser. The process starts with setting up the HTML structure, incorporating a canvas element for game rendering. CSS is applied to style the canvas and other elements for an appealing appearance. JavaScript plays a central role in implementing the game logic, defining tetrominoes, handling user input for movement and rotation, and managing the game grid. Drawing functions animate the falling blocks, and lines are cleared when completed. Rigorous testing ensures smooth functionality on different devices and browsers, resulting in an enjoyable online Tetris gaming experience.
